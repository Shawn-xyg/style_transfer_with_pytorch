    "# Style Transfer with Deep Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we’ll *recreate* a style transfer method that is outlined in the paper, [Image Style Transfer Using Convolutional Neural Networks, by Gatys](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf) in PyTorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this paper, style transfer uses the features found in the 19-layer VGG Network, which is comprised of a series of convolutional and pooling layers, and a few fully-connected layers. In the image below, the convolutional layers are named by stack and their order in the stack. Conv_1_1 is the first convolutional layer that an image is passed through, in the first stack. Conv_2_1 is the first convolutional layer in the *second* stack. The deepest convolutional layer in the network is conv_5_4.\n",

    "### Separating Style and Content\n",
    "\n",
    "Style transfer relies on separating the content and style of an image. Given one content image and one style image, we aim to create a new, _target_ image which should contain our desired content and style components:\n",
    "* objects and their arrangement are similar to that of the **content image**\n",
    "* style, colors, and textures are similar to that of the **style image**\n",
    "\n",
    "An example is shown below, where the content image is of a cat, and the style image is of [Hokusai's Great Wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Wave_off_Kanagawa). The generated target image still contains the cat but is stylized with the waves, blue and beige colors, and block print textures of the style image!\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='notebook_ims/style_tx_cat.png' width=80% />\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll use a pre-trained VGG19 Net to extract content or style features from a passed in image. We'll then formalize the idea of content and style _losses_ and use those to iteratively update our target image until we get a result that we want. You are encouraged to use a style and content image of your own and share your work on Twitter with @udacity; we'd love to see what you come up with!"
